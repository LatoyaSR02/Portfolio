        <p>I created a program that asks the user for a series of words and plugs them into a paragraph template.The
          desire to create a fun and interactive program that generates personalized sentences. Ensuring smooth flow and
          creativity in sentence generation based on user input. Seeing how the program dynamically generates unique
          sentences based on user input. The variety of sentences that could be created using a relatively simple
          template and user input. Successfully creating a program that combines user input and creative sentence
          generation. Beginners exploring user input, string manipulation, and creative program design in Python.
          Detailed comments explaining the purpose of each code segment and its role in sentence generation.</p>

        <p>For this project, we had to find the area of an irregularly shaped room with the shape as shown above. Then
          ask the user to enter the values for sides A, B, C, D, and E and print out the total room area.This project
          was challenging in the beginning as there had to be additional math done to find all sides. I overcame the
          challenge by using the formula to find areas for each shape.This project was challenging in the beginning as there had to be additional math done to find all sides. I overcame the challenge by using the formula to find areas for each shape.

        <p>In this project we had to design a fashion chatbot that helps people pick out their fashion preferences. Your
          bot can gauge what types of clothes and accessories the user might like.
          Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers
          depending on the answers the user inputs:
          - at least 6 questions
          - at least 3 if-elif-else statements
          - the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers.
          In this project we had to create a chatbot that asked the fashion tastes of the user. I enjoyed this project
          because it was very creative and fun using fashion to generate conditional statements.

        <p>Write a program that will ask a user how many numbers they would like to check. Then, using a for loop,
          prompt the user for a number, and output if that number is divisible by 3 or not. Continue doing this as many
          times as the user indicated. Once the loop ends, output how many numbers entered were divisible by 3 and how
          many were not divisible by 3.At first this project was challenging because I had to use the for loop to ask
          the user for an input and then use the if else statement to check if the number was divisible by 3. I overcame
          this challenge by using the modulus operator to check if the number was divisble by 3.

        <p>Using Python in EarSketch, I crafted a personalized ringtone by manipulating an array of sounds and effects.
          I designed a personalized ringtone using Python in EarSketch, incorporating various sounds and effects. The
          inspiration behind the ringtone was to achieve a dreamy effect.Balancing the repetition of sounds while
          maintaining interest posed a challenge. Creating a distinctive ringtone that remained captivating over time
          required careful considerationExperimenting with different synthesizers and sounds to achieve a customized and
          appealing ringtone was the most enjoyable aspect of the projectThe intricacies of creating a recognizable and
          aesthetically pleasing ringtone through code were surprising, showcasing the versatility of programming in
          audio design. I am most proud of the different sounds I used and the effects.

The animation featured carefully crafted stars and planets. I crafted an animated sequence depicting a rocket launch into space using Python. The animation included stars and planets, all programmed to simulate a visually captivating space journey.The inspiration for this project stemmed from a fascination with space exploration and a desire to combine programming skills with creative storytelling.Achieving a balance between realism and aesthetic appeal posed a challenge. Creating a visually stunning yet scientifically accurate depiction required careful consideration of proportions and movements.The process of bringing the celestial scene to life through code was immensely satisfying. Seeing the animation unfold as intended was a rewarding experienceThe complexity of simulating space dynamics and celestial bodies within the constraints of code surprised me. It underscored the intricacies involved in programming realistic visual elementsI am proud of successfully combining creativity with programming skills to produce an engaging and visually pleasing animation.</p></div>

        <p>For this assignment, we had to create a calendar program that allows the user to enter a day, month, and year in three separate variables as shown below. If a user chooses option one, the program should display how many days are in the month that they entered. If a user chooses option two, the program should display how many days have passed in the year up to the date that they entered.

        <p>In this program, I had to create a personal organizer. You will ask the user for the name of an event, the year it is happening, along with the month and day it is happening. If the user incorrectly enters one of those values, they are prompted to re-enter the information until it is correct. The user can do this for as many events as they have. After the user has entered all of the events, the whole list of events (along with their date) should be output to the user. It may sound simple, but there is a lot that goes into making this program!
