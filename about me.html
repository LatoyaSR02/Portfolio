      <div id="aboutme">Skills
        <p> Some of the soft skills that I have are communication, teamwork, problem solving, and leadership. My hard skills are analytical skills, academic writing, historical comprehension, CSS, HTML. and Python. In technical fields, hard skills represent technical proficiency and expertise. These skills are often quantifiable and can be measured through certifications or assessments. Soft skills enable individuals to communicate effectively with others. This includes verbal and written communication, active listening, and the ability to convey ideas clearly. Strong communication skills are vital in various aspects of life, from workplace interactions to personal relationships.</p>

        <div id="aboutme2">Extracirriculars
        <p> I am apart of the Girls Basketball Team at Edison. I am also apart of SkillsUSA, National Honors Society, and National Science Honors Society. Being apart of the basketball team made me be around girls who have become my second family. I enjoyed being captain while it lasted. Being apart of NHS introduced me to students who are just as committed to me when it comes to academics. NHS is a way for me to branch out in science. Participation in extracurricular activities allows individuals to develop a diverse set of skills beyond the academic realm. This can include leadership, teamwork, communication, time management, and problem-solving skills. Many extracurriculars involve interaction with peers, teammates, or fellow participants. This social engagement helps individuals develop strong interpersonal skills, make friends, and build a supportive network. </p>

           <div id="aboutme3">Goals
        <p> My short term goals are to continue being on the gold honor roll for my average and becoming healthy after my injury. I also want to destress more and take more of my time and invest it into me. My long term goals are to get into my dream colleges, which are UPENN and Carnegie Mellon Goals provide a clear sense of direction and purpose. They help individuals and organizations understand where they want to go and what they want to achieve. Without goals, there may be a lack of focus and a sense of drifting without a specific destination. Goals serve as powerful motivators. They create a sense of purpose and drive individuals to work hard, overcome challenges, and persist in the face of obstacles. Having a goal in mind provides the motivation needed to stay committed to the pursuit of success. </p>
