        <p> 



I bring a blend of soft and hard skills that make me a great team member. My soft skills such as communication, teamwork, problem-solving, and leadership, help me connect with others, build strong collaborative relationships, and approach challenges thoughtfully. In terms of technical skills, Iâ€™m skilled in analytical thinking, academic writing, historical analysis, and programming with CSS, HTML, and Python. I believe my strong communication skills allow me to convey complex ideas clearly, whether working on technical projects or fostering teamwork, and these skills are crucial for both professional success and meaningful personal relationships.

        <div id="aboutme2">Extracirriculars
        <p> I have been a member of Edison's Girls Varsity Basketball team for almost 3 years. I am also a member of SkillsUSA, National Honors Society, and National Science Honors Society. Being a part of the basketball team made me be around girls who have become my second family. I enjoyed being captain while it lasted. Being a part of NHS introduced me to students who are just as committed as me when it comes to academics. NSHS is a way for me to branch out in science. Participation in extracurricular activities allows individuals to develop a diverse set of skills beyond the academic realm. This can include leadership, teamwork, communication, time management, and problem-solving skills. Many extracurriculars involve interaction with peers, teammates, or fellow participants. This social engagement helps individuals develop strong interpersonal skills, make friends, and build a supportive network. </p>

           <div id="aboutme3">Goals
        <p> My short-term goals are to continue being on the gold honor roll for my average and become healthy after my injury. I also want to destress more take more of my time and invest it into me. My long-term goals are to get into my dream colleges, which are UPENN and Carnegie Mellon. Goals provide a clear sense of direction and purpose. They help individuals and organizations understand where they want to go and what they want to achieve. Without goals, there may be a lack of focus and a sense of drifting without a specific destination. Goals serve as powerful motivators. They create a sense of purpose and drive individuals to work hard, overcome challenges, and persist in the face of obstacles. Having a goal in mind provides the motivation needed to stay committed to the pursuit of success. </p>
