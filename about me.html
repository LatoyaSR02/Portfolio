        <p>In this project we had to design a fashion chatbot that helps people pick out their fashion preferences. Your
          bot can gauge what types of clothes and accessories the user might like.
          Your chatbot should ask the user the following (minimum requirements for the grader) and then give answers
          depending on the answers the user inputs:
          - at least 6 questions
          - at least 3 if-elif-else statements
          - the use of the random module and randomly generated numbers.
          In this project we had to create a chatbot that asked the fashion tastes of the user. I enjoyed this project
          because it was very creative and fun using fashion to generate conditional statements.
